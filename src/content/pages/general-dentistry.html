                Our General Dentistry Services
            </h2><br>
            <p>
                At Happy Smile Dental Clinic, we offer a wide range of general dentistry treatments tailored to your needs:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Routine Dental Check-Ups & Exams
            </h3><br>
            <p>Regular dental check-ups are essential for early detection of oral health issues. During your visit, we will:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-1074">
                <li class="cs-li">Examine your teeth and gums for signs of decay, cavities, or infection.</li>
                <li class="cs-li">Perform oral cancer screenings.</li>
                <li class="cs-li">Take digital X-rays (if needed) for a detailed assessment.</li>
              </ul>
            
            <h3>
                2. Professional Teeth Cleaning (Scale & Polish)
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                A professional cleaning removes plaque, tartar, and surface stains, leaving your teeth healthy and refreshed. Regular cleanings help prevent gum disease and maintain long-lasting oral health.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Tooth-Colored Fillings & Cavity Treatment
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                If you have a cavity or minor tooth damage, our tooth-colored composite fillings restore your tooth’s strength and appearance, blending seamlessly with your natural teeth.

            <h3>4. Gum Disease Treatment</h3><br>
            <p>
                Healthy gums are the foundation of a strong smile. We provide scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) to treat early gum disease and prevent further complications.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Tooth Extractions (Including Wisdom Teeth Removal)

            </h3><br>
            <p>
                If a tooth is damaged, decayed, or impacted, we offer gentle and pain-free tooth extractions, including wisdom tooth removal, to prevent further oral health issues.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Fluoride Treatments & Dental Sealants
            </h3><br>
            <ul class="list-1074">
                <li class="cs-li">Fluoride treatments strengthen enamel and prevent cavities.</li>
                <li class="cs-li">Dental sealants protect back teeth (molars) from decay, making them great for children and adults alike.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>7. Custom Mouthguards & Nightguards
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                We offer custom-made mouthguards for sports protection and nightguards to prevent teeth grinding (bruxism), reducing the risk of enamel wear and jaw pain.
            </p>
